# Etherlink MeshPay - Decentralized Offline Payment Network

A revolutionary DeFi protocol that enables seamless offline payments through a self-healing mesh network architecture. Built for the Etherlink hackathon, this project combines IEEE 802.11s mesh networking with a pre-funded side-chain to enable sub-second retail payments during Internet outages.
